If you want to have the help in another xterm window, you could use this
command:
<code>
    :!xterm -e vim +help &
</code>

<h3 class="help-headline"><a name=":helpfind">:helpfind</a> <a name=":helpf">:helpf</a></h3>
:helpf[ind]     Like |:help|, but use a dialog to enter the argument.
            Only for backwards compatibility.  It now executes the
            ToolBar.FindHelp menu entry instead of using a builtin
            dialog.  {only when compiled with |+GUI_GTK|}
            {not in Vi}

                    *:helpt* *:helptags*

:helpt[ags] [++t] {dir}
            Generate the help tags file(s) for directory {dir}.
            All "*.txt" and "*.??x" files in the directory and
            sub-directories are scanned for a help tag definition
            in between stars.  The "*.??x" files are for
            translated docs, they generate the "tags-??" file, see
            |help-translated|.  The generated tags files are
            sorted.
            When there are duplicates an error message is given.
            An existing tags file is silently overwritten.
            The optional "++t" argument forces adding the
            "help-tags" tag.  This is also done when the {dir} is
            equal to $VIMRUNTIME/doc.
            To rebuild the help tags in the runtime directory
            (requires write permission there):
            <code>
                :helptags $VIMRUNTIME/doc
            </code>
           {not in Vi}

<span class="help-headline">3. Writing help files                   <a name="help-writing" class="help-tag">help-writing</a></span>

For ease of use, a Vim help file for a plugin should follow the format of the
standard Vim help files.  If you are writing a new help file it's best to copy
one of the existing files and use it as a template.

The first line in a help file should have the following format:

<a name="helpfile_name.txt" class="help-tag">helpfile_name.txt</a> For Vim version 7.3 Last change: 2010 June 4

The first field is a link to the help file name.  The second field describes
the applicable Vim version.  The last field specifies the last modification
date of the file.  Each field is separated by a tab.

At the bottom of the help file, place a Vim modeline to set the <span class="help-option">textwidth</span>
and <span class="help-option">tabstop</span> options and the <span class="help-option">filetype</span> to <span class="help-option">help</span>.  Never set a global option
in such a modeline, that can have consequences undesired by whoever reads that
help.

TAGS

To define a help tag, place the name between asterisks (*tag-name*).  The
tag-name should be different from all the Vim help tag names and ideally
should begin with the name of the Vim plugin.  The tag name is usually right
aligned on a line.

When referring to an existing help tag and to create a hot-link, place the
name between two bars (|) eg. <a class="help-link" href="#help-writing">help-writing</a>.

When referring to a Vim option in the help file, place the option name between
two single quotes, eg. <span class="help-option">statusline</span>


HIGHLIGHTING

To define a column heading, use a tilde character at the end of the line.
This will highlight the column heading in a different color.  E.g.

<h3 class="help-heading">Column heading</h3>
To separate sections in a help file, place a series of '=' characters in a
line starting from the first column.  The section separator line is highlighted
differently.

To quote a block of ex-commands verbatim, place a greater than (&gt;) character
at the end of the line before the block and a less than (&lt;) character as the
first non-blank on a line following the block.  Any line starting in column 1
also implicitly stops the block of ex-commands before it.  E.g. 
<code>
    function Example_Func()
    echo "Example"
    endfunction
</code>

The following are highlighted differently in a Vim help file:
  - a special key name expressed either in &lt;&gt; notation as in &lt;PageDown&gt;, or
    as a Ctrl character as in <span class="help-special">CTRL-X</span>
  - anything between <span class="help-special">{braces}</span>, e.g. <span class="help-special">{lhs}</span> and <span class="help-special">{rhs}</span>

The word "Note", "Notes" and similar automagically receive distinctive
highlighting.  So do these:
    *Todo   something to do
    *Error  something wrong
